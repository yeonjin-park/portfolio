# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
Text here...

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
I'm planning to use `my personal work log datasets` that I collected from the time-tracking software called Timely. Since I recorded all my work processes from last October, I will group some timestamp datasets within each project name(e.g. Thesis, Job Hunting, Digital Design System) and export all of those into csv. Recently, I worked on grouping my 2 months' activities related to my Thesis and I attached the related file below. I'll update the following other projects part whenever I finish those.

|   School Project Worklog(TBD)   |     |             |

# Method and medium
> FYI: I'm planning to actively use Figma to present the overall user experience of my visualization idea, then integrate with Tableau to implement some of the charts in that Prototype. I previously talked about this with professor Goranson.


- Data: Collecting `my personal worklog from Timely(Oct 2022~Jan 2023)` and export the datasets as .csv
- Overall prototype: Planning to use `Figma prototype` to showcase high-fidelity design of the dashboard and smooth overall user experience.
- Working prototype: Planning to use `Tableau` to implement one of my idea (e.g. Weekly or Monthly view of the timeline overview chart)
- Documentation: Figma prototype with Tableau Link
