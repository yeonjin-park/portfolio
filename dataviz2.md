# Visualizing government debt
Welcome! In this page, I'll show three different types of visualizations regarding the government debt. 

## First Assignment

## Second Assignment

## Third Assignment
**The different methods of visualization, and how they compare/contrast to one another**

**Why I chose the third data visualization**
I chose a "Bubble Chart" type and attached two different types of visualizations which showcase both the overall flow of the debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021 and yearly values by using a time slider. Other than bar or line charts, I thought the bubble chart visualization could effectively show both each ratio value and overall trends based on a timeline. The point that struggled me while using this tool was locating legends on the most rights side of the chart, matching with the bubble. I couldn't find a way to solve this problem, so ended up locating the legend on the top, which makes the chart quite confusing since it has too many numbers of the nations.
