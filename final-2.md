# Wireframe and Storyboard

## Wireframe draft in Figma 
I initially started with a more product promotion-style website for the presentation but decided to move to the `cartoon style with a user scenario` since using the story would be more compelling for people and easy to follow. I tried to put some `feature-focused parts` (features: Overview timeline&Comparison) while people scroll down the user scenario so that they can easily grasp what features the users can use in the scenario. After finishing drawing the user scenario, I am planning to spend more time on exploring visualization types on the service I suggest.

## Storyboard
Before I started creating the wireframe, I came up with the story arc regarding the service for figuring out `what will be the entire user's career life along with the suggested features`. While I ideated the storyboard, I also put additional features(Trends, Network maps) on it as a future consideration. The storyboard mainly now focuses on the `entire career path of a tech worker with the service`, but I'll soon cover specific roles with different career levels like junior product designer, senior PM or lead engineer, etc. 
- `Yellow tag` refers to user actions with the service
- `Orange tag` refers to user situations(context)
