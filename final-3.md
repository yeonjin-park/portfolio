# Major Changes and Updates from Part 2
## Change of an audience 
Originally my project target was tech workers ranging from product designers to engineers. Because of that reason, I created a user flow that shows a product designer's entire life with the tool I suggested. However, after a few discussions with professor Goranson, I changed from a designer to a graduate student since the storytelling itself should be sympathized by the audience of the class, which are students. This also made some light changes of the datasets used in the visualization, from product designers to students. 

## Changed structure 
As my project was more focused on the solution itself rather than the problem statement, I needed to create a balance in my final presentation by cutting off the product feature part and putting more focus on the visualization I used for the design solution. Again, the professor helped me a lot to find the right way, and I made several revisions to get to this level. I moved all the detailed information about features to the other page(also added left navigation), and also included another page for explaining how I exported my work log datasets from Timely and created a sample working visualization using Tableau. 

## Design Decisions
### Colors 
In terms of the tag colors, I referred to the current calendar or time-tracking tools' color usage as they already considered the complexity of chart design color settings, like using consistent brightness with different color hues.

### Timeline 
I thought the vertical timeline might be easier to read the information as users can scroll down the long records to see the entire time stamps. If it was a horizontal timeline, then the user might feel confused seeing the chart moving left to right while scrolling down. 

### Stacked Area
Initially, I used a line area chart without making all projects stacked. So all the projects overlapped, and those areas made users more confused when the number of projects rose. So I changed to the stacked type.

### Gantt Chart
Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, and it is focused on showing different categories’ start and finish times in time period blocks. It is mainly used for project management to show tasks, but I thought this logic could also be used for showing the career flow that the person created so that it can help them to reflect their entire career in a more intuitive way. It’s a visualized version of a resume. The reason for not using a single bar chart is that people sometimes work in multiple places, and that will cause overlaps in the bar. 


# Post-presentation Reflections
This project started from my personal experience of recording my work progress for a long time using various types of software. I previously used Google Calendar obsessively to record all my activities, but it was really exhausting since I needed to manually put all the information. After I used the auto-tracking service, I could focus more on the reflection and planning part rather than the recording. For this reason, I wanted to talk about the usefulness of this tool and also did some design work that I wanted to integrate into current time-tracking tools since currently most of them just provide a timeline feature. After finishing the presentation, I felt somewhat content with the fact that I informed my findings to all classmats.


# References 
Since all of the datasets used for my final projects are my personal data collected from Timely, there are no references in my case.
