# Critique by Design
Welcome! In this page, I'll showcase a data visualization about `how I spent my time on the Thesis actually with a compared to my plan over 2 months`.  

## [ðŸ”— A Link to the original data visualization](https://public.timelyapp.com/reports/LD7QYJYwrd6Ho1pPFvpRkP6Z) 
### **Why I chose this visualization?**
<br /> For this assignment, I used my own datasets which has recorded for around 2 months(Oct 10th - Dec 10th, 2022). To precisely record all my work process and boost a productivity regarding the thesis, I logged all my digital footprints on the desktop and phone related to the thesis by using `Timely service and their AI software`. Timely supports a data visualization feature based on collected datasets, and I chose one of their charts design that showing `planned vs. logged datasets on the thesis project`, since I felt there are some points that can be improved on for a better user experience. 

<br /> `Video Recording`
<br />Since the design I want to improve is not the public page one, I attached the video that shows the private user page experience.
