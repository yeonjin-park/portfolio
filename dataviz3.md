# Critique by Design
In this page, I'll showcase a data visualization about `how I spent my time on the Thesis actually with a compared to my plan over 2 months`.  

## [ðŸ”— A Link to the original data visualization](https://public.timelyapp.com/reports/CzCFGNvbGUuK1BuyejmyR6mJ) 
### **Why I chose this visualization?**
<br /> For this assignment, I used my own datasets, which has recorded for around 2 months(Oct 10th - Dec 16th, 2022). To precisely record all my work processes and boost productivity regarding the thesis, I logged all my digital footprints on the desktop and phone related to the thesis by using `Timely service and their AI software`. Timely support a data visualization feature based on collected datasets, and I chose one of their charts design that shows `planned vs. logged datasets on the thesis project` since I felt there are some points that could be improved on for a better user experience.

### **Visualization(GIF)**
<br />Since the design I want to improve is not the public page I shared on the top, I attached the GIF that shows the private user page experience.

## âŒ› Progress
### **Step 1. Insights I gained from the critique method**
<br /> 1) Which part stood out to me, and worked well? 
- Overall, the simple hierarchy and clear design of the visualization help users to recognize the trend of each planned and logged dataset without any confusion. 

<br /> 2) What it led me to think about when considering the redesign? 
- It doesn't present the datasets that can give meaningful insights to users, such as visually highlighting the gap between planned and logged. 
- The design only shows weekly datasets, not considering time granularity which covers detailed, daily information that the AI already tracked. 
- The unit used in the x-axis is not easily read by users (W47 -> Week 47 -> October Week 3).    

<br /> 3) Who's the primary audience of this tool, and is it effective?: 
- The primary audience of this tool is people who work most of their time using digital devices and also need to check work progress for their productivity and self-advocacy in the workplace. For example, the audience can be freelancers, project managers, remote workers, and consulting firms workers.â€¨I guess this visualization is showing meaningful information, but it only provides really basic insights to users presenting the trend of weekly logged/planned datasets. To be more effective, it needs to highlight more in-depth insights that this dataset can create.

### **Step 2. Sketch Wireframe**
<br /> While I critiqued the original visualization based on the given criteria(Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile), I came up with some new ideas and drew the rough structure on my sticky note. The idea mainly focuses on `providing additional tabs(time/tags) to users` so that they can explore more meaningful datasets by themselves, not only `polishing visual details or revising unit issues`.

<br />
  Then I redrew the wireframes by using iPad, also considering the detailed layouts and interactions when user clicks each tab.

### **Step 3. User Interview**
<br /> 1) User 1: Student, Late 20's
<br /> Q1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
<br /> A1. Yes. I noticed that this is about the work progress time log about the thesis since I read the title first. Also, the chart clearly shows what to deliver as it mainly consisted of two pieces of information - logged data and planned data. I can see a person usually worked less than a plan but sometimes more.

<br /> Q2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? 
<br /> A2. Itâ€™d be great if the visualization used transition animation when the user clicks between week and day since I thought the legibility of the day information is lower than the week because of the large number of data points. I also would like to suggest showing a pie chart of the activities (application usage, time stamps) besides the list.

<br /> Q3. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
<br /> A3. Freelancers or students. It would be useful for people who have to control all the worktime by themselves and prove their work progress clearly to clients.

<br /> Q4. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
<br /> A4. Itâ€™d be nice if users could also see some meaningful information like patterns, lowest/highest, etc, so that they can extract insights to plan their future easily. Maybe this tool also can suggest to users some plans for the upcoming day/week/month.

<br /> 2) User 2: Student, Late 20's
- Need visual consistency between both line charts (Log/Tag options). I prefer filling out inside of the line chart like the original chart since it clearly shows the differences among different instances. 
- Showing detailed user activities on the right side can bring users information overload. Maybe need additional depth(user action) to get access to this information.
- If possible, providing an insight dashboard would be helpful so that users can easily grasp insights from this dataset. (e.g. You spent 57% of your total working time on the prototyping phase during 2 months.)
- Color usage: need to highlight the "logged" dataset more by giving more contrast on two line graphs. (e.g. use grey color for "planned" line graph).

---
### **Step 4. Build it!**
<br /> First of all, I exported all the datasets into `.csv` from Timely so that I can use it for creating a visualization. I deleted some of the columns which will be not used for the design process. 
![Export_1](export-3.png)
> (L)Original .csv file (R)Processed .csv file

<br /> What I changed based on the user feedback: 
- Changed the color of each line graph to deliver a clear hierarchy between planned and logged datasets.
- Visual consistency: Filled out inside of the all different line charts.
- Created a on/off button for showing the user activities, which can reduce user's information overload. 
- Highlighted a pattern which can help user to find insights easier. 


## ðŸ“Š Final Design
### **How I spent my time on the Thesis actually with a compared to my plan over 2 months**

![Prototype 4](prototype-dataviz.gif)
> A sample user experience with Figma prototype  

<br /> I mainly used `Figma` to create a data visualization prototype since it can showcase as many details as possible I planned. You can check the overall user experience from the below Figma prototype. I also implemented `a simpler version of this idea by using Tableau`, with the actual datasets I extracted from Timely. 
- What my data visualization shows 
<br /> It presents different depth of the information mainly based on time granularity and tags attached on each input. Also, it provides multiple options which users can utilitze as a tool to explore the visualidation that can lead them to proactively find meaningful insights for improving their productivity and building their future plans. 
- Why I selected the visualization 
<br /> I decided to follow overall the same structure with the original design, a line chart, because that format will show the most detailed information but at the same time overall trends of each dataset.
