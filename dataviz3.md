# Critique by Design
In this page, I'll showcase a data visualization about `how I spent my time on the Thesis actually with a compared to my plan over 2 months`.

### **Why I chose this visualization?**
<br /> For this assignment, I used my own datasets, which has recorded for around 2 months(Oct 10th - Dec 16th, 2022). To precisely record all my work processes and boost productivity regarding the thesis, I logged all my digital footprints on the desktop and phone related to the thesis by using `Timely service and their AI software`. Timely support a data visualization feature based on collected datasets, and I chose one of their charts design that shows `planned vs. logged datasets on the thesis project` since I felt there are some points that could be improved on for a better user experience.

### **Visualization(GIF)**
<br />Since the design I want to improve is not the public page I shared on the top, I attached the GIF that shows the private user page experience.

## âŒ› Progress
### **Step 1. Insights I gained from the critique method**
<br /> 1) Which part stood out to me, and worked well? 
- Overall clear design that shows the trend of each planned and logged dataset. 

<br /> 2) What it led me to think about when considering the redesign? 
- It doesn't present the datasets that can give meaningful insights to users, such as visually highlighting the gap between planned and logged. 
- The design only shows weekly datasets, not considering time granularity which covers detailed, daily information that the AI already tracked. 
- The unit used in the x-axis is not easily read by users (W47 -> Week 47 -> October Week 3).

### **Step 2. Sketch Wireframe**
<br /> While I critiqued the original visualization based on the given criteria(Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile), I came up with some new ideas and drew the rough structure on my sticky note. The idea mainly focuses on `providing additional tabs(time/tags) to users` so that they can explore more meaningful datasets by themselves, not only `polishing visual details or revising unit issues`.

  Then I redrew the wireframes by using iPad, also considering the detailed layouts and interactions when user clicks each tab.

### **Step 3. User Interview**
<br /> 1) User 1: Student, Late 20's
- Need visual consistency between both line charts (Log/Tag options). I prefer filling out inside of the line chart like the original chart since it clearly shows the differences among different instances. 
- Showing detailed user activities on the right side can bring users information overload. Maybe need additional depth(user action) to get access to this information.
- If possible, providing an insight dashboard would be helpful so that users can easily grasp insights from this dataset. (e.g. You spent 57% of your total working time on the prototyping phase during 2 months.)

<br /> 2) User 2: Student, Late 20's
- Color usage: need to highlight the "logged" dataset more by giving more contrast on two line graphs. (e.g. use grey color for "planned" line graph).

---
### **Step 4. Build it!**
<br /> First of all, I exported all the datasets into `.csv` from Timely so that I can use it for creating a visualization. I deleted some of the columns which will be not used for the design process.

<br /> What I changed based on the user feedback: 
- Insights bullet point


## ðŸ“Š Final Design
### **How I spent my time on the Thesis actually with a compared to my plan over 2 months**
<br /> I mainly used `Figma` to create a data visualization prototype since it can showcase as many details as possible I planned. You can check the overall user experience from the below Figma prototype. I also implemented `a simpler version of this idea by using Tableau`, with the actual datasets I extracted from Timely. 
- What my data visualization shows 
- Why I selected the visualization 
- What I attempted to show differently
